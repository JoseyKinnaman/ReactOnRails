# Questions and Answers

Below are a few questions to help us get to know more about you and your
development experience. Feel free to edit this file and put your answers
below the questions.

## Tell us about a tool you enjoy working with (gem, library, framework, service, etc.). Why would you be sure to use it in your next project?

I truly enjoy working with React. I love how seamless it is with client side rendering and how modular and dry the code can be with functional components and hooks. I love using it on the front-end of Rails projects.

## What are your favorite personal contributions to the projects you work on?

*Great examples include features added to company apps, open source contributions, and exceptional answers on community forums.*

My favorite and most notable contribution to a project would have to be my time spent on the React.js refactor for the admin side of the Nike News app. I worked on it at the Ruby on Rails agency, planet Argon in Portland, Oregon. During my time on the project I suggested the implementation of functional components and hooks versus strictly using class components. My suggested was accepted and I was able to create tickets for components on the project alongside completing 9 components myself. I also implemented testing on the project with Jest and the React Testing Library that did not exist prior to my time at Planet Argon.


## In your own words, what happens when you visit a single URL of a Rails app?

*The best answers should be about a paragraph in length.*

 An HTTP request consists of the URI, method, header and body. Applications receive HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. Regardless of whether you are coding in Ruby/Rails or C#/.NET, you'll use some sort of pre-built web framework to receive an HTTP request, define what code to run, and return an HTTP response. Rails uses RESTful routing for Crud responses so when you are going to a single url you are seeing the results of MVC (Model, View, Controller) to handle those requests. Controllers handle web requests, figuring out what model code to run and which views to return back in the HTTP response.

## What resources do you use to keep your Ruby, Rails and other development skills sharp?

I attend the Portland Ruby Brigade monthly to speak with other Ruby developers (actually from around the world), I listen to podcasts (The Maintainable Podcast is a big favorite), and I read blogs. I also participated in the Rails Survey recently to see how other members of the community are using rails as well. I spend a lot of time coding on my own as well. I really love YouTube and Udemy tutorials and I do an edabit problem daily.
